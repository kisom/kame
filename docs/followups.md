# Follow-ups

Open work, most pressing first. Tick items off or delete them as they land.

## Typography

- [ ] **Word spacing (on hold).** Justified text without hyphenation leaves
  wide gaps. cosmic-text picks each break on its own and only widens spaces.
  Soft hyphens from `hypher` are not enough: on 378 devlog paragraphs at type 18,
  lines with a space over 2x normal fell from 17.1% to 10.3%, but the widest 1% got
  worse, up to 13 hyphenated lines ran in a row, the hyphen is invisible, and the
  inserted characters break the byte-offset invariant. The likely fix is for kame
  to choose its own breaks across the paragraph, with limits on hyphen runs and
  stretch. About 24 call sites read cosmic-text's lines directly, so prototype it
  outside the repo first, then write a spec.

## Markdown import

- [ ] **Tables (deferred).** Simplified on import because the model has no equivalent.
  Tables are wanted but too complex for now, and a code block is the stopgap.

## From earlier feedback

- [ ] **PDF export (on hold).** Still open in `feedback2.txt`; not required for v1.

## Sync

- [x] **Syncthing can replace a `.kame` file while it is open.** kame now notices, stops saving
  to it, and asks whether to merge the two, save this copy elsewhere or open the one on disk.

## Ideas

- [ ] **Sync for drift between one person's machines.** Designed and prototyped: see
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-11-03-sync-design.md` and `crates/kame-sync`. It merges document
  states by block and sentence, keeps a conflict's other version in a note, and carries revisions in
  logs that each have one writer. The design is accepted. The app merges conflict copies and replaced
  files; revision logs are the next stage.

- [ ] **Footnotes in the site's margins.** Sidenotes beside their markers on wide screens, so
  readers don't jump to the foot and back. Held back because kame already separates the two: a
  marginal belongs beside the text, and a footnote is there if wanted. Long footnotes would also
  stack and drift, and on narrow screens they'd have to fold back into the text. Worth trying if
  footnotes on the live site start to feel like they belong in the margin, most likely as a
  `site.yaml` setting, changing only how a page lays them out and not what kame stores.
- [ ] **A kame notebook.** The long-term goal, and notes are in `MultiKame.kame`: an
  extended kame for a binder of kame and Markdown documents, with search across them, quick
  linking and publishing by path.
